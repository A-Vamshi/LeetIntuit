## 🕹️ LeetIntuit

LeetIntuit is a retro UI–themed application that uses artificial intelligence to help you build intuition around solving coding and logical problems—without ever revealing the actual solution or code.

## 🧠 What is LeetIntuit?

LeetIntuit is your AI-powered sidekick designed to guide you toward understanding how to approach a problem logically. Instead of handing you a solution, LeetIntuit offers hints, breakdowns, and strategic thinking patterns that stimulate your problem-solving abilities.

Whether you're preparing for coding interviews, learning algorithms, or sharpening your logical reasoning, LeetIntuit provides just enough guidance to lead you in the right direction—without spoiling the journey.
